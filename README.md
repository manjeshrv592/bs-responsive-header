# Responsive header with HTML/CSS & Bootstrap-5

Every landing page needs a responsive header. I built this header boilerplate beacuse I found bootstrap navbar kinda looked boring.

You can use this boilerplate as a starter kit for your website. It contains locally linked bootstrap css and js files. (Bootstrap v5.3)
